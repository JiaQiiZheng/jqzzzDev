    sub_title: "A proposal of productive landscape",
    paragraph: [
      "This proposal started from the concern about a sharp decline of wild oysters in Apalachicola Bay. Through a mapping investigation, the Jim Woodruff Dam, controlled by Georgia State, caught my attention. By analyzing the dam inflow & discharge historical data, I found it blocks a tremendous amount of fresh water from flowing into the Apalachicola River since 2010.",
      <br />,
      <br />,
      "According to locals, the best growing season for the oyster is from September to April because of the cooling water. However, the upper stream inflow and the dam discharge during this period are seriously out of synchronization. Not only oysters, but productive species like Nyssa Ogeche and their habitat are all suffering from the dry river.",
      <br />,
      <br />,
      "Is justice 40 too binary (divide communities into advantaged and disadvantaged groups matching to rough aid program) ? How could we make up a disadvantaged community such as Apalachicola without considering its overharvesting impact on the ecosystem? People in Apalachicola pay a 56 million dollar legal fee for the water fight with Georgia and had few efforts in healing its freshwater shortage problem. How could we effectively help it escape from the vicious circle caused by regional limitations?",
      <br />,
      <br />,
      "This proposal introduces a new aquaculture infrastructure and designs the shoreline as a productive landscape along the city. Residents and tourists are invited to participate in this cultural landscape. It tends to create new opportunities for local industry.",
      <br />,
      <br />,
      "The modulized infrastructure design is a concept of adaptive design. Landscape not only serves as a space but also as a tool for participants to get delicate feedback on the ecosystem. To oyster farmers, it represents the base of their productive decision. To others, it represents how we experience the culture. To all of us, it represents how we escape from ecosystem dilemmas.",
